# ANSWER A.
# 1. Create a variable name first with value 7.
# 2. Create a variable name second with value 44.3.
# 3. Print result of adding first to second.
# 4. Print result of multiplying first by second
# 5. Print result of dividing second by first

first = 7
seconde = 44.3

print(first + seconde)
print(first * seconde)
print(seconde / first)


# ANSWER B
# What will be the values of a, b, c at the end?

a = 8
a = 17
a = 9
b = 6
c = a+b
b = c+a
b = 8

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# a = 9
# b = 8
# c = 15


#  ANSWER C.

#Is there a difference between the two lines below? Why?
# no difference

# What is the issue with the code below?
#error

#Suggest an edit.
my_number = 5+5
print("result is: " + str(my_number))



#  ANSWER D.
# What will be the output?

x = 5
y = 2.36

print(x+int(y))

# 7



#ANSWER CHALLENGE:
# Fix the following code, without changing a or b

a = 8
b = "123"

print(str(a) + b)
#or
print(a + int(b))
